This file contains the expected output of --validate-extension-api when run against the extension_api.json of the
4.3-stable tag (the basename of this file).

Only lines that start with "Validate extension JSON:" matter, everything else is considered a comment and ignored. They
should instead be used to justify these changes and describe how users should work around these changes.

Add new entries at the end of the file.

Validate extension JSON: Error: Field 'classes/AudioStreamPlayer3D/properties/playing': setter changed value in new API, from "_set_playing" to &"set_playing".
